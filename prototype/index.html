      <p>This is a paragraph element, it is a block element providing padding and setting itself on a new line from other content. 
      <em>This is an emphasis element.</em> it italicizes words usually within another text based element. Unlike the paragraph "p" element the "em" 
      element is inline meaning it stays with the flow of surrounding content. It does not take upo full horizontal space nor does it place itself on a new line. 
      This is an element called <strong>strong</strong> it works just like the emphasis element except it is for bolding a word or phrase rather than italicizing. 
      It has the highest emphasis of the two.</p>

      <p> This is another paragraph element and inside of it we are going to have some quote elements, first will be inline within the paragraph element: 
        <q cite = https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q >"The 'q' HTML element indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. 
        Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; 
        for long quotations use the 'blockquote' element."<cite>From MDN Web Documentation on the inline quote element.</cite>
        </q>
      this quote contains a "cite" attribute with the link from the source website.</p>
